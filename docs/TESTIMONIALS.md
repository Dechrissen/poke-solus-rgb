# Pokémon Solus RGB: Testimonials

Here are some nice things people have said about this romhack (comments from [YouTube][youtube], [Reddit][reddit], etc.).

> This honestly sounds like exactly what I want from a thought-out RBY Near vanilla hack. I really like the trader npc and you solved all the issues with one time pokemon like the starters, and fossils. None of the pokemon were placed in weird spots. [...] This would probably be my go to gen 1 hack now that doesnt stray far from the originals because of how well thought out your reasoning is for why youre making each change.

> TBH There are some decent Gen 1 hacks but i think This one has the potential to be 1 of the better ones. Nothing crazy just a lot of fixes and some QOL. i'll keep an eye out for this one.

> After reading through the updates you’ve made, this is basically exactly what I’m looking for in a romhack of the original first Gen games. The addition of the field move slot for HMs and the trade back NPC being located in Celadon are great quality of life features. [...] You crushed it - this one is getting added to my list

> Incredible you fixed core issues without adding ultra custom changes. You kept it as canon and tasteful as possible. Will be playing through this one very soon!

> A nice, simple modification that doesn't overreach and doesn't drastically change the game? Fixing annoying issues that, while not dealbreakers, definitely subtract from the enjoyment? Implementing features that make it possible to play the game in the way you want? Not fixing the "issues" presented by modern fans looking back at Gen 1?

> Dude this is amazing. You're keeping the games as vanilla as possible while actually making good and needed changes. I would love if you ever decided to make a gen2 Solus with the same philosophy and changes to make both roms not only compatible but also to work as the real sequel to Solus! Solus RGB + Solus GSC.

> You're the best! You listed everything, I thought of in my first playthrough, way back.. You made my wish come true. The perfect RedBlueGreen versions. Sir, I'd shake your hand, and invite you for a slice 🍕 if I could.
