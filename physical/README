Solus RGB box art and other assets
----------------------------------

In this directory you'll find the official box art for Solus RGB, as well as other assets which can be used in order to produce physical copies. The GB box art fronts can also be used for emulator frontends (like RetroArch) should you want a proper cover image.

- Official box art (front only, GB-sized): [gb-fronts/](gb-fronts/)
- Game Boy cartridge labels: [gb-labels/](gb-labels/)
- DS-style (front + back) slip inserts: [ds-box-slips/](ds-box-slips/)
    - These will fit standard US DS game boxes, like [these](https://www.customgamecases.com/online-store/Gameboy-Gameboy-Color-Gameboy-Advance-GB-GBC-GBA-c133115504)
    - Canvas size (for the entire sheet) is A4

- Old, closer-to-vanilla versions of the GB box art: [old/](old/)
    - These were my noob attempt at minimal covers before I worked with an artist to commission proper ones
